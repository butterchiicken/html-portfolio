<h3>Crazy Stupid Love</h3>
<p>
    Um this was so unbeliveably good and I am grumpy that everyone gate-kept Ryan Gosling from me.
    I never understood the Ryan Gosling hype until 2 minutes into this movie and it all made sense. 
    Emma stone is perfect as always. The little kid is great but very weird. Same with the babysitter. 
    I didn't mind Steve Carrel in this so thats good. Honestly Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's relationship
    is the only reason needed to watch this movie. Very good.

<h3>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</h3>
<p>
    Incredible movie. Even more incredible book. I cried a whole bunch at the end. I love Charlie and 
    Sam and Patrick and the whole friend dynamic. I will always cringe at the Charlie and his girlfriend
    scene it is ahhhhh so uncomfy. He is so precious and Logan Lerman is my favourite because of it. I read
    the book after seeing this movie again and it is even better. There's so much that was left out but 
    it was important to have the PG rating and I get it. Charlie is such a sweet bean.

<h3>The Spiderwick Chronicles</h3>
<p>
    This movie is perfection. The greatest movie ever made. My entire childhood. Jared/Simon is perfect
    and even though he is stupid I am him and he is me. It is comedic genius and also just the perfect magic
    world. It is the definition of the word fantastical and this movie is my childhood. I can recite the entire
    thing and I will always love this movie.
